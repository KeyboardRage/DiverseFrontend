          Although we track who did what, none of these actions tells user which
          staff issued this case. It is irrelevant to them and protects the
          staff team from potential personal vendettas.

          It is recommended to always attach images such as proof, reference,
          screenshots, DM’s, etc. along with the cases. All images are stored on
          our end. This is very valuable information. This can also be added
          later, after the case is created—also by other staff members.
          <p></p>
          When a case is created here, the action is automatically carried out
          in the guild, and an event is posted in moderation logs.
